Strategic Planning for Renewable Energy Deployment in Greece:

 

1. Wind Energy:
- The top SHAP values for wind energy production are related to wind speed and direction, with the highest values found in Kozani, Agxialos, Aktio, and Aleksandroupoli.
- Based on the average optimal conditions, the best locations for wind energy production would be Kozani, Agxialos, and Aktio.
- In Kozani, wind turbines should be placed in areas with high wind speeds and in the direction of the prevailing winds.
- In Agxialos and Aktio, wind turbines should be placed along the coast to take advantage of the strong winds coming from the sea.
- It is also important to consider the environmental impact and potential conflicts with local communities when selecting specific locations for wind energy production.

2. Solar Energy:
- The top SHAP values for solar energy production are related to temperature and humidity, with the highest values found in Kalamata, Kozani, and Argos.
- Based on the average optimal conditions, the best locations for solar energy production would be Kalamata, Kozani, and Argos.
- In Kalamata, solar panels should be placed in areas with high temperatures and low humidity to maximize energy production.
- In Kozani and Argos, solar panels should be placed in areas with high temperatures and moderate humidity levels.
- It is important to consider the availability of land and potential shading from nearby buildings or trees when selecting specific locations for solar energy production.

3. Hydro Energy:
- The top SHAP values for hydro energy production are related to wind speed and direction, with the highest values found in Kozani and Argos.
- Based on the average optimal conditions, the best locations for hydro energy production would be Kozani and Argos.
- In Kozani, hydro turbines should be placed in areas with high wind speeds and in the direction of the prevailing winds.
- In Argos, hydro turbines should be placed near rivers or other bodies of water with strong currents.
- It is important to consider the potential impact on local ecosystems and communities when selecting specific locations for hydro energy production.

4. Geothermal Energy:
- The top SHAP value for geothermal energy production is related to temperature, with the highest value found in Kozani.
- Based on the average optimal conditions, Kozani would be the best location for geothermal energy production.
- Geothermal power plants should be built in areas with high temperatures and accessible geothermal reservoirs.
- It is important to conduct thorough geological surveys and consider potential environmental impacts when selecting specific locations for geothermal energy production.

5. Biomass Energy:
- The top SHAP values for biomass energy production are related to temperature and humidity, with the highest values found in Kozani and Argos.
- Based on the average optimal conditions, Kozani and Argos would be the best locations for biomass energy production.
- Biomass power plants should be built in areas with high temperatures and moderate humidity levels.
- It is important to consider the availability of biomass resources and potential conflicts with local communities when selecting specific locations for biomass energy production.

Overall, the strategic plan for the placement of renewable energy sources in Greece should prioritize the locations with the highest SHAP values for each type of energy production. This will ensure maximum efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential environmental and social impacts of each renewable energy source and carefully select specific locations for their placement. Collaboration with local communities and thorough research and planning are crucial for the successful implementation of this strategic plan.
